CHAP. III. Containing a description of Regeneration.

SO haue we demonstrated the truth of this necessary principle of Christian religion. Now wee goe forward to explicate the same, and will endeuour to lay it open so cleerely, that every man may be able (if he be willing to bestow the labour of trying) to discerne of his own estate in this behalfe, and to say whether himself be regenerated yea or no. So will there be a ready way made, to that application of the doctrine which hereafter we intend. Now that this matter may be soundly conceived of by you, it shall be requisite for me to enter into a discourse consisting of foure heads. First, to giue a description of regeneration. Secondly, to shew in what order, and in what degrees, (as I may terme them) it is wrought in the sons of men. Thirdly, to declare what effects doe follow vpon it, there where it is wrought. Fourthly, to set downe the most eminent of those graces, that are to be found in regenerate men. Of which foure I pray you reuiue your attention to heare in order.

For the first point Regeneration, (called also sanctification, and renouation, and conuersion, and repentance, having the three former names giuen it, in as much as it is Gods work in vs; the two latter, in as much as we also being moued by God, doe work together with him for the accomplishing and fulfilling thereof; and fitly called a re-begetting, because in it we are restored to that image of God, wherein we were at the first created: but now, by meanes of our corruption through the fall, are altogether destitute of it in our first birth). This regeneration, I say, seemes to me conueniently described in these or the like termes: It is a work of the spirit of God, by meanes of the word of God, infusing holinesse into the whole man, for the glory of God in his saluation. I call it a worke, because it is so called of God himselfe, for wee are said to bee his workmanship, created in Christ, unto good workes: and because to beget, is to doe; to bee begotten, to suffer; in the plainest discourse of naturall reason. Now this work is in this description set out by all the causes, and by the subject thereof. The causes are foure, all briefly named in the description. The efficient, formall, materiall, and finall. The efficient is double, principall, and instrumentall. The principall, the sole author (in whom remaineth all the power of working, and to whom all the praise appertaineth) is the Spirit of God, the Holy Ghost, the third Person in Trinitie. The same Spirit by whom our Sauiour Christs Man-hood was conceived in his Mothers wombe, is the sole worker of this conception of grace in the heart of Christians. So doth our Lord himself instruct Nicodemus in the words following, saying, That that is born of the spirit, is spirit: and before Saint Iohn had told vs, that beleeuers were borne, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man; that is, not by any natural power, vertue, or strength, which is naturally inherent in them; but of God, that is, of the Spirit of God: wherefore in the New Couenant, the promise is made on this wise, I will put my spirit in your hearts: and in another place, I will poure forth my spirit vpon all flesh. The spirit of God that rests vpon our Sauiour Christ, doth descend frō him, unto those that shall bee his members; at the same time implanting them into him, and imprinting his image vpon them. No Angell can change mans heart, no Angell can quicken the dead soule, no creature can breath into us the divine nature: but we are the workmanship of God, by his spirit created unto good workes. This is the annointing oyle, that being poured vpon vs, doth consecrate us unto God. The holy Ghost himself (in a wonderfull and vndiscernable fashion, as the winde that bloweth where it lusteth) doth conueigh and insinuate himself into the man, whom he will beget againe to a new life, and becommeth purifying water to cleanse him; and an holy fier, comming downe from heauen, to consume his corruptions, and refine him for the Lords vse. And yet the Spirit of God, that could work of himself, and without meanes, pleaseth not so to doe in this great worke: but of his owne free-will, makes choice for himselfe, of a fit and blessed instrument for that purpose; even the Law of God, the whole doctrine of the Scriptures: which he hath for that end, made knowne to the sons of men by his holy Prophets; and which hath receiued this high commendation, from the Divine testimonie left in writing by Dauids pen, that it is perfect, and conuerteth the soule. This doctrin hath two maine heads; the Law, and the Gospel: The former vsed by Gods Spirit, as a necessarie preparatiue; the other, as a proper & essential instrumēt in this busines. Wherfore the Word is called the incorruptible seede, which being sowne in the heart, doth by little and little grow vp to a new creature; and Peter tels vs, that by the pretious promises, we are made partakers of the divine nature; and to his Apostles our Sauiour vttereth as much, saying, Now are you cleane by the word that I haue spoken unto you. There may be a question made, whither the Word of God read onely, may become effectuall to regenerate? or whither it must want this efficacie, vnlesse it bee preached, as well as read? To which question, mee thinketh that this should be a true answere, that the instrumentall power of regenerating cannot be denied to the Scriptures barely read, though preaching bee not ioyned withall. For why? seeing the doctrine of the Gospell is called, the ministration of the Spirit, and it is the doctrine of the Gospell, when it is offered to the vnderstanding by bare reading; therfore it must follow, that in such case also, it may become the power of God to saluation, and the instrument of the spirit to regeneration. The same precepts, promises and threats are by reading, deliuered to the mind of the man that readeth, or heareth the Word read; and why then should we thinke, that the Holy Ghost either cannot, or will not, work together with them? Yea doubtlesse he can doe it when he will, and will doe it then, whensoeuer he doth not (as often he doth not) affoord to men a possibilitie of enioying any other helpe then reading. Vnlesse the not being preached, could make the Word not to be the Law of God: I see no reason that it should bee thought vnable to conuert soules, without being preached. But withall wee must adde this, that the Word of God is made effectuall by the Spirit, more often, more vsually, more ordinarily, to beget a new life, in the preaching (that is to say, the interpreting and applying of it, by the mouth of a man, inabled and assigned to that worke) then in the bare reading: for the Lord hath appointed in his Church, Pastors and Teachers to be his Workemen, his Laborers, Dispensers of his heauenly mysteries, and Fellow-workemen together with him; that by becomming his instruments, to conueigh grace into mens hearts, they might become spirituall Fathers unto them; and by attendance (not to reading alone, but also) to doctrine or teaching, they might saue themselues and their hearers. And when Christ himself was pleased to raise vp the dead world of the Gentiles, unto the new life of godlinesse (and so to fulfill that which himself had foretold, saying, The dead shall heare the voice of the Son of God, and they that heare it shall liue). He commanded his Disciples to goe and preach unto all Nations: will any man make himself so simple, as to say, he meant thus; Take the volume of the Law in your pockets, and draw it out, and reade a Chapter or two at a time unto them? Nay doubtlesse, he willed his Disciples to do that, which they had so often seene and heard him doing; whose custome was (as wee may collect out of the fourth of Luke, where one instance is recorded, to make us conceive his ordinarie practice), when he had read, to interpret the Scripture by him read, as there he did, saying, This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your eares: and after to apply it to the hearers, as in the same place, he falles into the reproofe of their quarrelsomnesse against him, that would vpbraide him with the Prouerb of, Physitian heale thy selfe; amplifying his reproofe, with allegation of the examples of the Widdow of Zarepta, and the Syrian Naaman. So the Apostles could not mistake his meaning, when himself had by constant practice gone before you, in doing what he bad them doe. And therefore it will not at all follow, that because the word read, is able to beget faith; either the ministers may content themselues vsually to reade it, without preaching: or the people vsually content themselues to heare it so; and not be carefull to seeke for the preaching of it. For of such absolute necessity, and of such excellent worth is regeneration, that it is needfull to seeke it, (and sinfull not to seeke it) not only in some one of the most easie meanes that may sometimes procure it; but also in all the meanes (though neuer so painfull) that God hath appointed for it. Every man may reade himselfe, yea must reade, if he can. This is a duty that might haue beene performed, without establishing of any ministery in the Church. But the Minister is, not only to reade; but also to diuide the word of truth aright, to exhort, improue, rebuke, to speake to mens edification, exhortation & comfort; that he may be truly called a fellow-labourer with God, in ye work of mens saluatiō. Shal we rest our selues satisfied in one thing, that may conuert? shall we thinke it enough to bee constant in one exercise, that may work grace? Doubtlesse if wee doe so, our owne worldly wisdome and diligence shal rise vp in iudgement, and condemne our spirituall folly and negligence. Yea brethren, in things temporall, men stand thus affected: that as they will neglect nothing, that may promise them any furtherance to their good successe; so they will shew most care, and most earnestnesse, in that which they haue cause to thinke, will be most auaileable for their purpose. Now without question, the word preached is more vsually, and more powerfully effectuall to regeneration, then the word read. The holy Ghost doth more often, and more mightily work by the word interpreted, and applied, then by it barely repeated out of the booke. I thinke him not worthy to bee reasoned withall, that will stand in deniall of this matter. Reade the stories of holy writ, and search and see, if the examples of men by only reading regenerated, bee not few, rare, seldome; nay scarce any where at all to be found: but on the other side, the examples of men by preaching made new, common, frequent, and vsuall. Therefore be it againe concluded, that he doth farre vnderualue the gift of spiritual life; which satisfying himself in the lesse vsuall, and lesse auaileable meanes of working it, because it is most easie; pretermitteth the more auailable, and more vsuall, because he is not willing to vndergoe the paines, labour, or cost that it will require. And thus you haue the efficient causes of regeneration. Gods spirit as the chiefe, the word principally preached, as his instrument. The materiall cause is holinesse, that is the thing, in the working of which regeneration is conuersant: Holinesse (I say) the most admirable of all things in all the world: as farre surpassing wit, and learning, and riches, and other earthly vanities; as learning surpasseth ignorance, and wealth beggery. This is (as it were) the character of Christ Iesus, the image of God, the beauty, the riches, the strength, the life, the soule, of the soule & of the whole man: It is a very beame of the divine light, called therefore by the Apostle, The divine nature; it is the most excellent and worthy thing under heauen, or (of things incident to creatures) in heauen. It is that, that distinguisheth Angels from diuels; the Saints, from the damned Ghosts. Take away from a blessed Angell his holinesse, he will become a blacke fiend of hell. It is (in a word) the best of all things that a creature can haue; without which nothing is worth the hauing; and with which the meanest condition is able to affoord a man happinesse enough. This admirable thing, that can by no words be sufficiently commended, is giuen by regeneration; and therefore wee call it the matter of regeneration. Now holinesse is nothing else but this, a supernaturall power of withdrawing the faculties of the whole man from sinfull and earthly obiects, and exercising the same vpon God, and the things of God. This Adam had in his first creation, and that in such perfection as God required at his hand. This should he haue propagated to his sonne; and his sonne, to his sonne, had he continued in his innocency: so that to him the same thing was naturall (and to his innocent posterity should haue been), which now to us is aboue the power and course of nature to attaine; and therefore need wee to get it by a second birth, because wee cannot get it in our first birth. For the naturall man doth not conceive in his mind (and consequently neither apply his will and affections to receiue) the things of God, as the Apostle speaketh: yea his mind is alwayes bowing and bending, after either bare earthly, or very hellish obiects: but because these things must be spiritually discerned, therefore the holy Ghost endues him with a new power of raising himself vp, from these base and filthy matters, unto his Creator, the eternall fountain and first cause of being and of blisse, even unto the God of heauen; in comparison of whom, all things are lesse and worse then nothing: and likewise unto the things of God, remission of sinnes, the fauour of God, communion with Christ Iesus, encrease of holinesse; and the like to these, which are by an excellency called the things of God: because they are the chiefest of all those things, that he bestowes vpon the sons of men; and to the seeking whereof, he directs them in his holy word, whereas else they would neuer haue sought them. This is the materiall cause of regeneration. The formall is, infusion, as witnesseth the Lord himselfe, saying; I will poure vpon the house of Dauid, the spirit of grace And in another place, I will poure flouds vpon the dry ground. And Paul saith, God hath giuen us the spirit of a right mind. For whereas some qualities are implanted in men by nature; some attained vnto, by their owne industry, and by vertue of certaine actions for that purpose performed; and some againe are wrought in thē, by a supernaturall work of God: this gift of holinesse, is neither naturally descended unto them, (as it should haue been, had their parents been innocent); nor yet attained by their diligence and paines, or by force and power, of any action done by them: but is put into them, by the spirit of God, working aboue and beyond, either their power, or the power of the acts that they shall doe, for the attaining of it. Let us make the matter more plainly vnderstood by comparisons. The power of seeing, is naturally bestowed vpon all men in their very birth, and by the course of nature working in their mothers wombe. This power or vse of this facultie is altogether denied unto some men, and they are born starke blinde, as was he of whom we reade in the Gospell. Christ with spettle made cley, and having anoynted his eyes, bade him to wash, and he returned seeing. We say now that into this man, the power or act of seeing was infused: for why by nature he could not see. The spettle, cley, water, had no such naturall force in them, as to work the power of seeing in an eye, that through naturall indisposition, wanted it. Wherefore it must needes be infused, that is wrought in that person, by a supernaturall work of God. So againe, Health is a qualitie; sicknesse (for example a burning ague) taketh away this qualitie of health. A man being so sicke, of such a disease consulteth with Physitians, receiueth potions from them, and recouereth his health: this qualitie now was acquired, or gotten by paines and industrie. For by vertue of some inherent qualitie in the medicines receiued, was this qualitie of health restored unto the body. But a man that was sick of an ague in the time of Peter, sending to him receiueth a napkin from him, and by the receiuing of it is healed. This health was an infused health, for not any power inherent in the cloth, or deriued from the body of Peter; but a supernaturall work of God, did procure that health at the presence of such outward actions. In like sort, Holinesse was to Adam a naturall power, or abilitie created in him, and with him, and immediatly accompanying his nature, or issuing from it. But the devil robbed him of it, by taking that from him, and poysoning him with the contrary naturall impotencie of sinne, (for I suppose we may well call sinne, I meane originall sinne, a naturall impotencie, or a mischieuous and corrupt disorder in all the faculties). Wherefore it is requisite, that he recouer it againe, if he shall be saued. Now the Lord of heauen pleaseth by meanes of the word (as it were by the spettle of his mouth making cley, to anoynt his eyes) to re-beget or recreate, this qualitie of holinesse in him; not that the word hath any natural inherent ability of working holinesse, no more then a napkin of curing an ague; but alone because the Lord sees it fit, in and with that doctrine to work this worke, by a power immediatly and solely deriued from himselfe. So may a man by long study obtaine the science of naturall Philosophie, which is a qualitie, and an habit; but the Lord did please by his owne immediate power, to deriue this science into the mind of Salomon: and therefore his knowledge was an infused knowledge, and more excellent for measure and degree, then euer any man did, or could attaine by studie. So the power of speaking and vnderstanding any language, is a quality, which by study, or custome of hearing and speaking, a man may work in himselfe; and he that by much labour and reading gets, for example, his Latin tongue, hath wrought this qualitie in himselfe; but the Apostles had the knowledge of speaking all, and by name the Latin tongue, put into them suddenly, by the immediate operation of the holy Ghost, and by vertue of a divine worke, in an vnconceiueable manner working in their imaginations. So we call holinesse an infused qualitie, because the holy Ghost, by vertue of his owne hand, and by power immediatly deriued from himselfe, not by vertue of any power naturally dwelling, either in man, or in the Word, doth please, in and with the word to work it in man. The spirit of life doth breathe it into those in whom it is, and they haue it by the meere efficacie of his divine power, not of the meanes in themselues, considered. Neither yet must we neglect those exercises and ordinances, in and by which it pleaseth him to co-operate, and to conueigh unto us this grace; but rather must with all diligence apply our selues unto them; that by making our selues subject unto his blessed will, we may likewise bee capable of this excellent work of his. Though cley made of spettle, and the water of Siloah, had no such vertue in them, as to make a blinde eye see, and to turne the naturall impotencie backe againe into the power of seeing; yet the man that was born blinde, was to vse that washing, and that cley: for else his disobedience to Christ, would haue depriued him of the divine vertue of Christ, which vpon his obedience, shewed it selfe in healing him. So regeneration is not attaineable by vertue of any act or acts, that wee or any creature can doe; but it commeth from aboue, and is effected by an inconceiueable power of Gods spirit, (for it must needes farre surpasse the strength of a creature, to change the soule, and to cause a returne, from so miserable a priuation or naturall impotencie, as sin is, unto so glorious, blessed and excellent an habit, or supernaturall abilitie, as that holinesse is, into which we are transformed). But for all this, he that would haue the holy Ghost shew his infinite power in making such a change in him; must willingly submit himself to the doing of any actions whatsoeuer, wherewithall the spirit of God shall manifest, that it is his pleasure to ioyne, this his happie and powerfull working. And such is the formall cause of regeneration. The finall cause, or the end of it, is the glorie of God, in the slavation of the partie regenerate. For to speake truth, it were a shame and reproch to the God of heauen, to let a sinner (that is to say, his professed enemie) come into heauen: for this would vpbraide him with falsehood, in regard of his word, and with want of holinesse and justice in his nature. Now the Lord cannot be so weake, as to doe any thing, that should giue him iust cause (to speake (as of God wee must needes speake) after the manner of men) of being ashamed thereof. Wherefore that he may with glory, and honour, and praise, and the content of his owne most holy nature, take thither, so many of the corrupted sons of Adam, as he pleaseth to make vessels of honour; it is his will and care, thus to change their nature, and to renew them by his spirit: and so he obtaineth the fullest fulnesse of glorie that may be, in their happinesse; being for euer praised, by all his holy creatures, and (which more is) infinitly satisfying himself in the beholding of the excellencie of that great work of their blessednes, and the most pure and holy and admirable meanes, that he hath ordained to bring them unto it. And these are the causes of regeneration. The next thing mentioned in the description is the subject of it: which is the whole man, in all the powers of the soule and of the body, according as the Apostle prayeth for the Thessalonians, that they might bee sanctified throughout, and that their whole soule and body might be kept blamelesse. And by this note it is differenced from all other changes, that may carrie any resemblance to it; they being all but partiall changes, either of the outside alone, and not the inside; or of some one power alone, not of all the powers: because indeed they are not fruites of holinesse, but either of hollownesse, and selfe-loue; or at best, of a bare and weake work of illumination. And thus haue I performed the first thing intended, in describing regeneration; of which if any man demaund what it is? wee say it is a change, that is, a bringing of a new and (here too of a) contrary qualitie, in stead of the old that was before; if who makes the change? the holy Ghost: if by what meanes? by the word: if in what manner? by infusion; that is, by the working of a proper and immediate vertue deriued from himselfe. If from what, and to what this change is? from the sinfulnesse of a man (which he receiueth from Adam successiuely) to holinesse. If wherein? in the whole man, soule and body, and all the powers of both: If to what end? to the glory of the worker, and slavation of him in whom it is wrought. O happy work of an happy workman, by an happy instrument! and thrice happy that man, in whom this blessed worker shall vouchsafe to accomplish this his most worthy, and excellent, and only blessed worke, to so worthy and blessed a purpose.
