chap. iiii. shewing the order of working regeneration.

now i proceed to declare, in what order the spirit of god pleaseth to performe this most admirable change: which is done in these four actions, which i shall lay downe. first, the spirit of god working, in and with the law, (but tempered with the gospell) becomes a spirit of contrition, causing a man to see and feele his extreme sinfulnes, and wretchednes, in so much that he is even wounded at the very heart therwith, and his sinful and unhappy estate becomes a woeful bondage & captiuitie unto him. the lord doth not alone raise up miserable terrors of conscience in him, in regard of some one or more gross offeÌ„ces that he hath actually committed, (although often he maketh these very terrors, a meanes of making himself a passage to enter in at), but he opens the eyes of the minde, to see the very mud and filth of the soule, that lay at the bottome before unseen and vndiscerned. the spirit convinceth him of sinne: it shewes him that generall wickednes and sinfulness of his nature, whereof we spake before. now he feels his vnbeliefe, pride, ignorance, hypocrisie, and other heart-corruptions. he iudgeth himself worthy to be destroyed, not alone having a sight of his own inability to escape damnation: but likewise of the justice of god in damning him, so that he doth even stoupe and yeeld himself thereto. whereas before he was aliue without the law, not having the true knowledg of it, now the law comming in the sound power and working of it, through the strength of the holy ghost; causeth that he becomes dead in his owne sense, and apprehension: but sin becomes aliue to his sense and feeling; and he perceiuing the strength, force, violence, and mischieuousnes of it, more then euer before, now cryes out with the apostle, o miserable man that i am! and now confesseth that he is carnall and sold under sinne, as the same apostle did, in the same sense of his naturall wretchednesse, which the comming of the life of grace had brought with it. thus the death of sin begins to be changed into life, in that it is felt and discerned. for the very first working of this new life, must needs be a feeling of the old death in sinnes and trespasses: not (i say) alone of his death in hell, in regard of his deseruing the torments thereof, but of his death in sinnes and trespasses, of his utter inabilitie to do any good thing, of his utter emptines of all heauenly graces; of his extreme slauerie to vngodlines, and vnrighteousnes, and all the lusts of the flesh; and of his perpetuall and vehement pronenes to all abomination and wickednes. there is often (i confesse) a work, and a very terrible work, of the law & the naturall conscience together, procuring most extreme and hideously-bitter pangs, and hellish agonies in the soule of man; where the spirit of regeneration neither is, nor euer shall be: this being alone a fruite of the spirit of bondage, not of the spirit of grace. and oftentimes againe, the spirit of sanctification comes into ye soule, together with this spirit of bondage, making a violent entrie, and by maine force breaking open the heart; formerly locked and barred against it; and so beginning this sauing work of holinesse. but terrors of conscience, which may be in all vnregenerate men, (because they are already in all the damned, into whom no part nor peece of regeneration can enter) is farre different from this first degree of the work of a new birth. the sanctifying spirit, laies the filthinesse, not alone the danger of sinne, before the eyes of the mind. it causeth a man, not alone to be in extreme anguish, because he feares he must be damned: but even to loathe and abhorre himselfe, and to be very vile in his owne eyes, because he knowes he hath deserved to be damned: and that so foule a thing as sinne, (wherewith his maker hath due cause to be so much displeased) doth not alone abide, but raigne and command in him. wherefore he doth even lie down at the foote of the throne of gods iustice, and in a most ardent abhorring of himselfe, doth subscribe to the righteousnes of god in his owne feared destruction; having nothing in the world to say for himself (as of himselfe), why he should not be destroyed: and not so much as a tittle of a word to obiect against the perfect and exact equitie of the liuing god, if that he should destroy him. sinne, i say sinne, not alone the punishment of sin, but sin it selfe, is discouered unto him: he sees its loathsomnes and vilenes; he sees its strength and violence; he sees his owne totall defilement; he perceiues himself throughly, and throughly polluted with it: and cries out bitterly, ah what shal i doe! not only, nor so much, because i shall be damned; but because i am so wicked, so sinfull, so contrary to god, so rebellious against him, so very a traytor unto him, and so vtterly vnable to mend these woful disorders of my soule. these be his groanes, these be his plaints, and his cryings out are of his wickedness and iniquitie, wherein he was conceiued, wherein he was borne, wherein he hath liued; and whereof now he perceiueth not so much as one part of his heart, or of his life, to be cleane, and vnspotted. this acknowledgement and sense of our sinfulnes, is the very first beginning of holinesse. the vnregenerate often sees and feels his damnation; the regenerate alone his sinfulnes, the miserable deprauation of his nature; the vtter, totall, odious, pollution of his whole man; being so loathsome, that he sees god cannot chuse in justice but detest him, and for any thing that is in himselfe, for euer reiect him. this apprehension of sinfulness is mixed alwaies at first (at least often) with the feare of gods wrath and vengeance: but it doth so temper and allay that feare, as the bitternes thereof, carries not the soule furiously to contend against god, as else he could not chuse but doe. for his hatred is not stirred now against god, whom in truth (by vertue of a secret, vnfelt, and undiscerned hope, that the spirit of god hath created, and doth vphold in him) he loueth, and honoureth, though he be more then half in doubt, lest he may destroy him: but alone against himselfe, his wretched hatefull selfe, that is so intollerably wicked and naught, that he can see no cause, but that the lord should glorifie his equitie and iustice, in damning him. and so much for this first work of regeneration: the second followes it close at the heeles, and is nothing else, but an earnest desire of attaining holines and vertue, together with remission of sinnes, and the fauour of god in christ iesus. for you must conceive the partie that is now in regenerating, to haue a generall knowledge of the doctrine of the gospell, and a generall assent also to the truth of it: this doctrine being (as i said before) an instrumentall cause of regeneration. but now the generall knowledge begins to bee made speciall, and the man touched with a sense of sinne, is moved also with a most vehement longing after grace and mercie; not alone to pardon his sinne, but also to heale his soule of it, as of a desperat wound, which he feeleth to be most smarting and mortall. so he cries out, who shall deliuer me from this body of death? no hungrie man did euer, with a more eager appetite, wish for meate; nor thirstie man for drinke; nor couetous man for money; nor ambitious man, for aduancement, then he now longeth to be reconciled unto god in christ; to haue his foule nature made cleane, his woeful sinnes forgiuen, his abominable corruptions remoued, and killed, and holinesse planted in their roome. oh how faine he would be holy! o how faine would he be humble, faithfull, obedient! how faine he would beleeue in, loue, feare, serue god! but, ah wretch that he is, he cannot: woe, woe, unto him, he cannot. o, how shall he be able to preuaile against these vile disorders of his heart, and life? how shall he do to be lesse sinfull, and more righteous? these be his thoughts, these his wishes, these his groanes: he findes so great a misse of nothing, as of the pardon of his sinne, and the graces of the spirit of god; and if he had that bestowed upon him, were he a beggar, a prisoner, a slaue, any thing; yet he should seeme to himself an happy man: and, ah lord, (thinkes he) that thou wouldest be pleased, for christ his sake, to forgiue my wickednes, and to heale my nature. now the thirst that he had after the things of this world, is wonderfully cooled; and, (as a man in a burning fit of an ague, makes no reckoning of his fine cloathes) he doth almost put off all those desires, and poore or not poore, esteemed or not esteemed, it is no great matter; but that he might be accepted into the fauour of god, and haue his sinnes pardoned and subdued, and his vnholy nature made holy, that is all in all within him. there is to be seene in vnsanctified men, in case of terrors of conscience, (which sometimes do lie long upon them) a great desire to be free from the insufferable euils they see comming upon them. for, who can make question, but that iudas would faine not haue been damned? or, that the damned in hell haue not a wonderfull desire get out of their torments? this being one maine aggrauation of their pangs, that they cannot but desire, to be deliuered out of those euils, which they cannot escape. but they, not having the supportation of the spirit of god to vnderprop them with hope, do vanish in these desires, and lose the fruit of them for lack of a kindly working of them towards the lord: for they be not lifted up to heauen-ward. but the man that is now in framing a new, (being sustained with the fore-mentioned secret hope) hath vehement and setled wishes, fixed and fastened in him; whereby he thirsteth after the grace of god, not alone to saue, but also to amend him. so the desires of the sanctified arising from the spirit, are differenced from the desires of the vnsanctified, that are meere fruits of nature, (which would faine be wel eased of an heauie burthen) by these two things: first, that they are directed unto god, whereas the other are rouing and confused desires. secondly, by their being set, alwaies, as well (often as much, somtimes more) upon holinesse, as upon freedome from punishment: upon the getting of vertue and goodnesse, as upon the getting of an heauenly kingdome; wheras the heart of the vnsanctified is so taken vp, (when he must needs feele it) with the sense of his misery and punishment, that he cannot haue while to settle any part of his longings, upon the renewing of his soule by grace; and so farre is the work of a new birth well proceeded. the poore dead man, being so far awakened out of his senselesse death in sinne, that with great disquietment he feels it, and with heartiest workings of his soule doth couet to come out of it: which last i take to bee the hungring and thirsting after righteousnesse; noted by our sauiour as a blessed note of blessednesse. in the third place, there is dropped into him the spirit of grace and supplications, by which he is at length imboldened to go unto god, and in some solemne and expresse manner, to utter his confessions and petitions; which before (perhaps) for some good space of time he could not dare to doe. for the former two workes of grace do often (a great while together) show themselues in sighes and grones, and sudden & strong eiaculations, & secret & vndissembled boylings up of desire, in deep wishes & longings, afore the poore sinner can take so much hart to himselfe, as to make a formed and setled prayer unto god. but after the working of these motions some while, he puts upon himself the resolution of the king of nineueh, and saith within himselfe, let me cry mightily unto the lord of heauen & earth; his mercies are infinite, who can tel, but that be may haue mercy upon me, that i perish not? (so is his secret sustaining hope, now formed and fashioned into the right proportion of a sauing grace, and shewes it selfe manifestly within him), he saith to himselfe, there is hope concerning this thing; and therefore i will cry, and continue crying, and let the lord do what he pleaseth unto me. then down upon his knees he fals, and with his hands and eyes lifted up to the throne of grace (yet almost afraid and ashamed to looke thither, and therefore ready often to rise vp, and start backe againe), he dares at last to poure forth his lamentable confessions into gods bosome; whom now he hopes he may haue leaue to call father, though (alacke) he haue been too too vngracious a child. thus he proceeds to arraigne and accuse himselfe; acknowledging (for which he hates himselfe, because it is so plaine that he cannot but know it), that he hath sinned in such and such, and such and such particulars; and that he hath a most filthy heart, as full of wicked inclinations and thoughts, he thinkes verily, as the sea it selfe is full of water. wherefore he passeth a very sharpe sentence upon himselfe, and that also very sharpely; plainly saying, with an inward assenting of his very soule, that he is fully worthy of all those plagues and punishments, which the lord hath threatened in his word, and will execute in hell; and that it should not be in the least degree iniurious, if god would not be mercifull unto him: for ah! how vnfit is he to receive mercy? but yet withall, he takes heart in the most humble abasement of himselfe, most earnestly to call, and cry, and beg for mercy, and forgiuenesse, and for the work of grace, to change his nature from that loathsome disposition which troubles him: now it may be, by the working of hope, having his heart so much softened, that teares (before stopped up by that binding force, that strong and secret sorrowes show themselues to haue in mans heart) do even begin to flow forth from him, to adde (if it might bee) a greater feruor unto his prayers. and if at first, second, third, fourth, and (it may be) many more times, he seeme to haue cried in vaine; because none answere commeth, but heauen it selfe seemes strongly stopped up against him: yet he goes againe still to the same throne of grace, againe reckoning up the same, and (if he can also) new sinnes, againe bewailing them bitterly, and heartily imploring both pardon and help againe. this is to come unto christ Jesus heauie laden, as our sauiour comfortably inuiteth vs; this is to seeke god while he may bee found, and to call upon him while he is neere, as the prophet exhorteth vs. which having done, he knowes not what to do more; and therefore even casts himself upon gods goodnesse through Jesus christ; and knowing that in him (the son) the father is well pleased, he striues to rest in him, continuing to knocke, continuing to seeke, because his heart giues him, yt at last he shal not faile to find acceptance. and this spirit of prayer seemeth to me so proper to the regenerate, that it caÌ„not any way befal the vnregenerate: who when he feeleth not his misery, doth but multiply idle words in seeming to pray, when he feeleth it is so wholly drowned and swallowed up thereby, that he cannot runne unto heauen for helpe. but with the regenerate, prayers and supplications are alwaies found, and a continuing therein also, how many bitter repulses soeuer he suffers at gods hand; as often he doth very many, the lord either deferring or making more speed to answere, as he sees most behoofefull for the profit of each of his seruants; and proportioning the fruit of his grace this way, to his knowledge of their ability and fitnesse to receive an answere, or to brooke delayes. it must not be denied, but that the man that neuer shall be regenerate (in the griping and twinges of his accusing conscience, through the working of the law, and the bare illumination of the spirit) may come so farre, as to roare out his lord haue mercy upon me, very often: yea, he may by perswasion and entreatie of friends, be brought to reade some good prayers out of a prayer-booke: yea, to be glad to haue an other pray for him, in his owne hearing; and in some sense also, to ioyne with him: yea more, by frequent perswading, vrging, teaching of some godly man, he may be drawne to pray for himselfe; but yet still the spirit of prayer is absent, in that he doth not finde himself by an inward moouing of his owne heart) inclined (in the middest of his griefes and feares) to betake himself (to god for helpe, by calling upon his name. and (which is a maine obseruation in this matter) if he pray, he prayes almost altogether for pardon, and for fauour, little for grace and holinesse; whereas the christian man, (by a secret drawing of his own inward soule, wrought by this regenerating spirit) comes unto the lord with his requests, begging grace and holines, with no lesse earnestnesse, then remission and saluation. yea, and having once begun this course, he finds so much refreshing thereby, that he cannot but continue to do it, even sometimes with much strugling against, of his own hart, through feares and doubtings thereof. so it is one thing to bee perswaded to pray by men, and to do it for ease sake; another thing to be inclined unto it, by the priuate and secret working of the spirit. one thing to beg for pardon, not much minding amendment; another thing to crie for the helpe of god to reforme ones heart and soule, as well as his free fauour to pardon former offences. an vnsanctified man, by benefit of christian acquaintance, in long and heauie terrours, may come to the one of these; to the other, alone the spirit of sanctification can leade one. to which passe, when the heart is once brought at length, the fourth act of the holy ghost doth plainely show it selfe; for it becomes a spirit of adoption within him, the very earnest penny of saluation, sealing up unto him the fauour of god, the pardon of sinne, the attaining of life; and by a new (and in truth considering the difference of former times) a strange worke, perswading him, that god is reconciled unto him, and hath accepted him for his childe. as it made him able to take unto him words, and go unto the lord, crauing to bee accepted graciously: so it brings him word againe from god, that he shalbe, yea, that he is, accepted gratiously; and answering him (euen as, one would say, with a sensible answer in the middest of his prayers oft-times) so strongly and vndoubtedlie ures him of his being heard, that he makes, for the time, no more question of it then whither he liues yea, or no. from which assurance of spirit (hauing tasted the sweetnesse of gods grace, and felt how good the consolations of his word and spirit are) he growes resolute in his very soule, for the time to come, in all things, to please god, and finds a new kind of disposition, inabling him to auoide euill, and do good; so having put his necke under the gentle and easie yoke of christ iesus, he finds rest unto his soule: and thus is christ formed in him, and he transformed into a new creature. for this firme purpose of will to please god in all things, is so manifest, and euident, and sensible a work of grace; that now we may say, this act of regeneration is growne to some good ripenesse, and even now perfected in him: before he was in making a new man; but now he is made new: now he is begotten againe, and become a son of god, and heire of his kingdome, and fellow-heire of christ. i know that it may befall an hypocrite (lying under the burthen of a terrified conscience, which may be totally and perpetually separated from regeneration, and regeneration from it) by the diligent inculcating of the comforts of the gospell, and the earnest labor of some christian and godly men (that in such case would faine speake peace), to bee brought (because they are told, there is none other way of comfort) to a purpose of neuer committing such and such gross sinnes, as they are accused of in their owne soules; and to some promise of amendment of life: but this is rather a resolution forced upon them by striuing of others, hereupon promising comfort; then a thing growing in themselues, out of the sense of the louing kindnesse of the lord their god. whereas a christian finds somewhat within him, inclining him, and making him to say within himselfe, and even little lesse then to sweare and vow with dauid, that he will surely keepe the righteous iudgements of the lord, and that in all things, and for euer, to his dying day. and thus is the work of regeneratioÌ„ brought to some perfectioÌ„, thus doth the holy ghost mould the soule of a man into a new fashion; thus doth he stampe upon him a new image, and as you would say, the very lineaments and proportion of god his father, whom in a sweete likenesse (that makes him amiable to god and angels), he begins to resemble. only my brethren vnderstand you one thing for the better conceiuing of all that hath been spoken. there are two sorts of regenerate men in the world. some it pleaseth god to call to himselfe, even very betimes, dropping pietie and grace into them, almost together with their mothers milke (by benefit of that great fauour of god, holy and christian education), and that even in certaine insensible degrees; so that they cannot so easily name the beginning and progression of this worke. in these all the forenamed things are most manifestly found (for in truth the working of them doth not cease, till life cease); and that so, as sometimes the one of these workes of grace is more strong then the other. sometimes they find a more sensible abasement of themselues within their owne hearts, out of the apprehension of their sinfulnesse; sometimes desires and prayers are more vehement; sometimes a comfortable resolution of pleasing god, doth more mightily stirre in them: yet because of the early working, and that they were wrought in a still manner by very small degrees, the work did almost go beyond obseruation; and they cannot so distinctly tell when they began to be abased, when to be raised vp. but there is another sort of men regenerate, who did liue a long time in vnregeneracie; yea perhaps also in profanenes, and notable and notorious wickednesse, (for oft it falleth out that the pharisies and scribes make lesse haste to the kingdome of heauen, then the publicans and sinners, i meane that the gross offenders are sooner regenerated then the ciuill liuers). now for such men, it pleaseth the holy ghost many times, yea most times, to work these four fore-rehearsed workes, very distinctly; making as it were some euident pause, betwixt each of them, and grace goes forward in them, even step after step, in the manner that hath been described. most times, if not alwaies, (the difference of their former life, when they were but dead, making the matter euident enough), they can name, when, and where, and by what meanes, the lord began first to lay them low, to pull them downe; and (as they say, in nature corruption and generation go together) to kil their old man by terrors; till being so slaine, he had in a calmer manner shewed them the filthinesse and lothsomnesse of it. they can tell, what longings they felt before they durst pray; and what adoe they had to bring themselues to pray; and then, how long they continued praying, before they were answered; and lastly, wheÌ„ that sweet tidings came, that rauished their soule with ioy, and made them so inamoured of gods goodnesse, that they even made a strong couenant with him, to walke in his waies and keepe his iudgements. all these things (i say) they can tell well, and nothing doth them more good, then to recount with themselues, this mightie act of the most high; whereby their foules (with as great a miracle as once lazarus his body) were raised up from the rotten graue of sinne, wherein they lay (wrapt up in the winding sheet of hardnesse of heart, and blindnesse of mind) stinking and putrifying; & (as a carcasse crawleth with wormes) swarming with those noysome lusts, that are able to poyson up an honest heart.
